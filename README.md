# 🐍 Snake-Game
A classic arcade-style snake game built using Python's turtle module! Guide your snake to eat food, grow longer, and avoid crashing into the walls or your own tail. Watch your score climb and try to beat your high score!

🎮 How to Play

  1. Use the Arrow Keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake.
  2. Eat the blue food to grow.
  3. Each bite increases your score!
  4. Avoid crashing into the walls or your own tail — or it’s game over (but your high score stays!).

🚀 Features

  1. Smooth movement with responsive controls.
  2. Automatically growing snake as you eat.
  3. Randomly placed food with fun colors.
  4. Scoreboard that tracks your current score and high score.
  5. Game auto-resets if you crash, but keeps your high score.

  Step 2: Eat the Food
  Move toward the blue food. Each time you eat, the snake grows longer and the score increases.
  
  Step 3: Watch Out!
  Avoid the edges of the screen. If you hit a wall or run into your own tail — reset!
